VNextDemo
=========

This is a playground for ASP.Net VNext.

The goal is to:

1. create a AngularJS based application based on ASP.Net version.
2. Implement a simple rest service (doing something stupid)
3. Have some unit tests
4. Deploy everything as :

- part of the same web application
- on a different set of web application
- self hosting into a desktop application
